# Doug Leinen

I am a full-stack software engineer working for a cool small branding agency [Geletka+](https://geletkaplus.com/). Check out my [portfolio](https://dougleinen.com) for my previous work.

I come from a background of art and music. I am interested in exploring how art and technology work together to make our lives better.
